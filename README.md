# GravitationalLens-MultimodalDL
A PyTorch implementation of the DeepGraviLens architecture for multimodal classification of gravitational lensing data. This project fuses image data with light curve time series using CNNs and LSTMs to detect and classify different scales of gravitational lenses, enabling advances in astrophysical survey analysis and dark matter research.
